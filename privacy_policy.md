# Privacy Policy for Safe Browsing Guard

Last updated: [Current Date]

## Introduction

Safe Browsing Guard is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our extension collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## Information Collection and Use

Safe Browsing Guard does not collect or transmit any personal data. All processing is done locally on your device. Here's how we use the permissions we request:

1. **Storage**: We use local storage to save your preferences and to keep track of which sites have been flagged. This information never leaves your device.

2. **Downloads**: We monitor your downloads to check for potentially harmful files. This check is performed entirely on your device, and no information about your downloads is sent to our servers or any third parties.

3. **Scripting**: We use this to inject warning messages directly into web pages when a suspicious site is detected. These scripts only run on your device and do not transmit any data.

4. **Tabs**: We access tab information to check URLs and update the extension icon. This information is processed locally and is not stored or transmitted.

5. **Host Permissions**: We require access to all websites to provide real-time protection against suspicious domains. All checks are performed locally on your device using our built-in lists of suspicious domains and file extensions.

## Data Storage

All data, including your settings and any logs of flagged sites, are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data, nor is it synced or transmitted to any external servers.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
